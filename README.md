As many of you, webmasters, use Dooplay theme on Wordpress for your movie websites, we decided to make this very easy guide how to set-up API player with Dooplay.

1. Upload the files to /wp-content/themes and allow to rewrite all files.

1. Purge all caching systems (WP Cache, Cloudflare...) to see the changes.


RECOMANDED SETTINGS:

- Go to Appearance ->Dooplay Options -> Video Player (tab setting) and set:
1. Ajax Mode -> ON
1. Delivery method -> wp-json

- Go to Appearance ->Dooplay Options -> Report and contact (tab setting) and set:
1. Reports Form - OFF

All the best, JorgBot Team !
